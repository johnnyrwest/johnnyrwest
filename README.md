### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer / full-stack developer.

My most recent endeavor was at Host A Fan, where we worked on building an MVP application from the ground up.

I built out some really cool features, and have included some in my Samples repo.

Some of the technologies used: 
 - React.js
    - Material UI
    - Formik/Yup
    - FontAwesome
    - Axios
 - .NET Core 3.1
    - WEB API
    - AWS / SeatGeek APIs
    - ADO.NET
    - Dependency injection
 - MS SQL Server
    - T-SQL queries and stored procedures
 - Git & CLI

Now I'm a Software Engineer at The Change Company where I've added on
  - Next.js
  - Auth0
  - Azure Devops

I look forward to sharing what I'm up to here on GitHub!
