### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer / full-stack developer.

My most recent endeavor was at Host A Fan, where we worked on building an MVP application from the ground up.

I built out some really cool features, and have included some in my Samples repo.

Some of the technologies used: 
 - React.js
    - Material UI
    - Formik/Yup
    - FontAwesome
    - Axios
 - .NET Core 3.1
    - WEB API
    - AWS / SeatGeek APIs
    - ADO.NET
    - Dependency injection
 - MS SQL Server
    - T-SQL queries and stored procedures
 - Git & CLI

In preparation for my next role, I'm staying sharp at all these as well as learning:
  - Next.js
  - Unit testing

I look forward to sharing what I'm up to here on GitHub!
