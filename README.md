### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer / full-stack developer.

I've been working at [The Change Company](https://www.thechangecompany.com/) building tools that help the CDFI mortgage market:
- [xChange](https://www.xchangefi.com/) is an e-commerce secondary loans marketplace
- [Prequalification](https://applynow.changemtg.com/) is a customer-facing mortgage pre-qualifier

Before that I was at [Host A Fan](https://hostafan.azurewebsites.net/), where I built an MVP application from the ground up.

Some of the technologies used: 
 - React.js (Next.js)
    - Material UI
    - Formik/Yup
    - Auth0
    - Axios
    - SWR
    - Redux / Redux-saga
 - C# / .NET
    - Azure Functions
    - ReST APIs
    - AWS
 - MS SQL Server
 - Cosmos DB
 - Azure Devops
