### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer / full-stack developer.

I've been working at [The Change Company](https://www.thechangecompany.com/) building tools that help the CDFI mortgage market.

- [xChange](https://www.xchangefi.com/) is an e-commerce marketplace for purchasing secondary loans
- [Prequalification](https://applynow.changemtg.com/) is a customer-facing mortgage pre-qualifier

My most recent endeavor before that was at [Host A Fan](https://hostafan.azurewebsites.net/), where I built an MVP application from the ground up.

Some of the technologies used: 
 - React.js (Next.js)
    - Material UI
    - Formik/Yup
    - Auth0
    - Axios
 - C# / .NET
    - ReSTful APIs
    - Azure Functions
    - AWS
 - MS SQL Server
    - T-SQL queries and stored procedures
 - Cosmos DB
 - Azure Devops
