### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer / full-stack developer.

I'm currently working at [Onward](https://www.onwardapp.com/) - a mobile application financial tool for co-parents.

Before that, I was at [The Change Company](https://www.thechangecompany.com/) building tools to help the community-driven mortgage market:
- [xChange](https://www.xchangefi.com/) is a marketplace for secondary loans
- [Prequalification](https://applynow.changemtg.com/) is a consumer-facing mortgage pre-qualifier

Before that I was at [Host A Fan](https://hostafan.azurewebsites.net/), building out an Airbnb-styled booking platform geared toward connecting traveling event-goers to locals who could host, lodge, and ultimately show them around town.
